# Neighborhood Map Project

## Overview
This is Project 7 for Udacity's Front-End NanoDegree. This project was built using create-react-app. This app uses the Google Maps API to display a map of a specific place and shows markers for a list of locations within that place. When the user clicks on the map markers, an infowindow will popup to display additional information about that location.

There is also a sidebar displaying the list of locations on the map in list view. The user can filter the list by typing into the input field.

## Setup

* clone this repository `git clone https://github.com/kay-ell/FEND-Project7-Neighborhood-Map.git`

## Special Note
